## Controls – Sounds Easy, But It's Not That Simple

### On PC:
- **A** or **Left Arrow**: Control the **left leg**  
- **D** or **Right Arrow**: Control the **right leg**  
- **Space**: **Jump** (for obstacles)

### On Mobile:
- **Tap left side** of screen: Left leg  
- **Tap right side** of screen: Right leg  
- **Jump Button**: Appears when needed

### 🎯 Effective Running:
Alternate taps between each leg evenly.

- Tap too slow? You’ll lose **momentum**.  

Speed Stars isn’t about spamming – it’s about rhythm, like playing piano with your fingers.

## Winning Tips for Every Level

### 🟢 Beginner – Getting Familiar & Gaining Control
- Start with 100m races to learn controls.
- Focus on even rhythm, not speed: `1-2-1-2` like real steps.
- Watch your character's reactions (leaning or head-shaking = bad rhythm).
- Practice 5–10 times daily to build muscle memory.

### 🟡 Intermediate – Optimize and Start Competing
- Move to 200m–400m races: learn rhythm & energy pacing.
- Count rhythm in your head or with music.
- In hurdle races, time your jumps with rhythm, not just visuals.
- Use ghost mode to compare with past runs.

### 🔴 Expert – Climbing the Leaderboards
- Build a rhythm that fits your own reflexes.
- Use headphones and background beats to maintain pace.
- For 800m races, save energy in the first 2/3, then sprint the final 100m.
- Adjust stride and taps to distance – longer races need slower pace.

## Conclusion – Time to Race for Real

**Speed Stars Unblocked** doesn’t need flashy graphics or complex mechanics.  What makes it so addictive is the feeling of real progress:

- Yesterday, you tripped on every hurdle.  
- Today, you finished 200m smoothly.  
- Tomorrow? You're climbing the leaderboard.

Let your fingers tell the story of your racing journey.  **Good luck, and race smart!**
